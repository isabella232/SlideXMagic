# About:
# I chose Perl as the first project language file for this project (SlideXMagic) as this project is going to make use of the Perl language for software diversity reasons, and also because Perl is a good language to use on some things. It will be accompanied by many other languages, such as ActionScript, TypeScript, JavaScript, WebAssembly, and XHTML, just to name a few.
